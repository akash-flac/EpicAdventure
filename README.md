Epic Adventure
-
A text-based RPG game built using C# and Visual Studio. The game will let you create a player, set up locations for them to travel to, discover quests to complete, and fight monsters.                                 
This project was built as a way of learning C# and OOPS, along with diving into the world of building tech projects, understanding code bases and game logic.
